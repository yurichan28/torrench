Torrench is a command-line program to search and download torrents from torrent-hosting sites. It's compatible under **Linux and Windows** operating systems. 

* MacOS Users: I don't own a Mac hardware, so unable to test on it. But, I think it should work fine, considering the code is written keeping cross-platform in mind. Try and report back maybe? Thanks.
	* **_UPDATE: Tested on Yosemite by me as well as a user. Worked great!_**

Torrents can be fetched from following websites:
1. linuxtracker.org - Download linux distros ISO torrents.
2. DistroWatch - Another linux distro ISOs repository.
3. The Pirate Bay (TPB)**\***
4. KickassTorrents (KAT)**\***
5. _More to come..._

### \* Using The Pirate Bay(TPB) / KickassTorrents(KAT)
By default, searching thepiratebay(TPB)/kickasstorrents(KAT) from torrench is disabled. The user should configure and enable it to use. I have provided configuration steps, but before moving to configuration, please note the following:

* Using TPB in many countries is illegal. Using TPB can get you into un-intended troubles (e.g notices/block from ISP). Read [Legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#Legal_issues)
* Neither I, nor the tool shall be held responsible for any action taken against you for using TPB from torrench.
* Illegal searches [example](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#searches-considered-illegal)
* This should be enough. Please see [Configuration steps](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#configuration-instructions) to enable TPB.

_Torrench initially began as a python learning project for me. I am sure there are ways to implement code I wrote in a much better/efficient way. Do [let me know](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench#contact) or [Open issue](https://github.com/kryptxy/torrench/issues/new) if you come across any. 
Alternatively, you can also send a pull request._

_I believe this project can go a long way. I'll need your help expanding it, and keeping it active. Suggestions/Feedbacks are highly appreciated. (I'll soon upload the contributions how-to)_

## Features
* Supports all \*nix distros
* Displays results in organized, tabular form.
* [linuxtracker] Supports filtering search using categories

### **[Common to both TPB/KAT]** 
* Surf torrents Ad-free
* Fetch Torrents on basis of pages [1 page = 30 results (max)] [(-p) argument].
* **Display colored results on basis of uploader's status** (Very useful when choosing torrent).
	* TPB: 
		* VIP Uploaders [text in green]
		* Trusted Uploader [results in magenta]
		* General Uploader 
	* KAT (KickassTorrents):
		* Verified uploaders [Uploader's text in yellow]
		* Seeds [in green]
		* Leeches [in red]
* Add torrent directly to torrent client through **magnetic links** without opening/fetching details.
	
### ThepirateBay Features
* Get complete torrent details (Description, comments, torrent download). **Torrent details are available in dynamically-generated HTML pages.**

* Fetch Comments on basis of pages [Useful when torrent has large number of comments, and not all comments are intended to be fetched].

### KickassTorrents Features
* Get upstream [KAT] link which can be opened using browser.

### Note
* A torrent might take long to fetch results. I have generally faced this issue when running torrench for the first time. When this happens:
	* Abort the ongoing search [Ctrl+C]
	* Search again. The second time generally works fine.
